# To generate a 2048-bit RSA private key
openssl genrsa -out private.pem 2048


# To obtaining a certificate is to create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) file
openssl req -new -sha256 -key private.pem -out csr.pem

# Once the CSR file is generated, it can either be sent to a Certificate Authority for signing or used to generate a self-signed certificate.
# Creating a self-signed certificate using the OpenSSL command-line interface is illustrated in the example below:
openssl x509 -req -in csr.pem -signkey private.pem -out cert.pem

# To list details of Certificate
openssl x509 -in cert.pem -text
# or for p12/pfx
openssl pkcs12 -nokeys -info -in ca-cert-p.p12


# To generate a .pfx or .p12 file:
openssl pkcs12 -export -out ca-cert-p.p12 -inkey ca-private.pem -in ca-cert.pem
# or add CA additionally
