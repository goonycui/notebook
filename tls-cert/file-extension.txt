# p12 and pfx:
p12 is an alternate extension for what is generally referred to as a “PFX file”, it’s the combined format that holds the private key and certificate and is the format most modern signing utilities use. Same with alternate extensions are .PFX, .PKCS12

The PKCS#12 or PFX format is a binary format for storing the server certificate, any intermediate certificates, and the private key in one encryptable file. PFX files usually have extensions such as .pfx and .p12.

# pem , crt , cer , key:
The PEM format is the most common format that Certificate Authorities issue certificates in. PEM certificates usually have extensions such as .pem, .crt, .cer, and .key. They are Base64 encoded ASCII files and contain "-----BEGIN XXXXX-----" and "-----END XXXXX-----" statements. Server certificates, intermediate certificates, and private keys can all be put into the PEM format.

Apache and other similar servers use PEM format certificates. Several PEM certificates, and even the private key, can be included in one file, one below the other, but most platforms, such as Apache, expect the certificates and private key to be in separate files.
